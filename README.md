## Credits
This project was done in the context of the teaching unit of [LIFPROJET](http://cazabetremy.fr/wiki/doku.php?id=projet:presentation#enseignants)
at [University Claude Bernard Lyon 1](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/).

Graphics are handled with [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/), using the [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) implementation.

Window management and event handling are done with [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/).

Image loading is done with [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb).

Mathematics functionnality, such as vectors and matrices were handled by [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm).
